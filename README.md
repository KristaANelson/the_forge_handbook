# The Forge Handbook

The Glassbreakers product team knows culture is the key to building an amazing team and product.  The Forge Handbook consists of our processes we’ve put into place in only a year of Glassbreakers existing for future employees, a resource for any designer/engineer and our internal team to bring productivity as well as consistency to what we build everyday.  While these documents are never permanent and ever changing, it’s been an important part of our team building discussing what's important to our building processes.
